	 <strong>I remember the first time we started talking, it was on 18th November 2018. From that day 
	 I started liking you firstly because you are cute, funny, and I wanted to start talking to meet you as a person. 
	 <br>Even tho that was mission impossible :D, I didn't stop. I tried and tried but it was unsuccessful. 
	 Until I found my shot when you started playing Minecraft. <br>It was 25th of May 2020. I was like:"this must be another
	 chance, let's try again", and what do you know, it worked. <br>We started talking more, i'll never forget the videocall
	 and never forget you how you put your blanket above your head and we watched horror clips on youtube. <br>I'm thankful
	 to God that I don't forget nice moments so easily. I remember them forever. The first time we went out together, 
	 I mean on Yellow Fortress, it was beautiful especially because you were there with me. <br>That beautiful face, and 
	 gorgeous eyes I was lost. Even tho we froze we had great time together. When I got home I told myself, yes she is the
	 one. Then I started sending messages again. We stayed together till 6 in the morning, started going out, I was more than happy
	 and now pfpfspfps Im the happiest man alive. Thank you baby for being here with me and making my days better and full of live and love.
	 <br>You are the best girlfriend ever, I love you so much. I can't wait for New Year, to spend 3 days and 2 nights together.</strong>
